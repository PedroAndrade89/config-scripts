Pedro Andrade, Poppulo Systems engineer interview 2

Brief description of the architecture:

There are 2 ways to deploy the helloapp application

	1. helloapp_deploy.yml

		This ansible playbook, will deploy a python flask application together with a Python Web Server Gateway Interface called gunicorn running on port 8000, additionally, nginx web server is also deployed which will work as a reverse proxy to the application, this server is listening on port 80 and will redirect requests to port 8000

		This ansible playbook can be deployed in a CentOS 6.X or CentOS 7.X server

	2. helloapp_dockerdeploy.yml

		This ansible playbook, will deploy a python flask application together with a Python Web Server Gateway Interface called gunicorn running on a docker container called helloapp, this container will be exposed on port 5000 and will map to host port 8000 additionally, nginx web server is also deployed which will work as a reverse proxy to the docker container running our application. the application, his server is listening on port 80 and will redirect requests to port 8000.

		This ansible playbook can only be deployed in a CentOS 7.X server


Requirements:

Prior to running these playbooks a sudo user must exist or be created on the target server. (ex. create user and add it to wheel group)

SSH keys with ssh agent are the best ways to use ansible. So it's best to use ssh-keygen to generate a key pair and then use ssh-copy-id command to copy the public key to the target host

If this is setup correctly then the ansible ping command should be successfull:

HW15468:flask-deploy pandrade$ ansible --inventory-file=hosts -m ping webserver -u karl
pandrade-nginx3 | SUCCESS => {
    "changed": false,
    "ping": "pong"
}



Running the application:


	1. tar -xzvf deploy_scripts.tar.gz
	
	2. cd /deploy_scripts

	3. Edit hosts files and fill values <ssh_user> and <target hostname> accordingly

	4. Run command "ansible-playbook -u <ssh_user> --inventory-file=hosts helloapp_deploy.yml" to deploy in CentOS 6.X or CentOS 7.X target hosts

	5. Run command "ansible-playbook -u <ssh_user> --inventory-file=hosts helloapp_dockerdeploy.yml" to deploy in  CentOS 7.X target hosts

	5. Open a browser and type "http://<target_hostname>/hello" or run command 'curl -i -X GET "http://<target_hostname>/hello"'
